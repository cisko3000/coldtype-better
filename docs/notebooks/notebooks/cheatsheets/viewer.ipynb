    "The most common viewer shortcuts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``spacebar`` play the animation\n",
    "* ``<left>`` go back one frame\n",
    "* ``<right>`` go forward one frame\n",
    "* ``shift+<left>`` go back ten frames\n",
    "* ``shift+<right>`` go forward ten frames\n",
    "* ``a`` render all the frames of the animation to disk\n",
    "* ``cmd+a`` render just the current frame to disk\n",
    "* ``,`` display the rendered version of a frame (and hit ``,`` again to display the live version) — in general this is useful if you want to play the disk-rendered version of an animation (for playing back at correct framerate/speed if animation generation is complex & consequently not realtime)\n",
    "* ``.`` toggle audio support (if you have the ``[audio]`` extra successfully installed)\n",
    "* ``<home>`` go to frame 0\n",
    "* ``q`` quits viewer and kills running coldtype program (equivalent to ctrl-c in command-line or hitting the X in the viewer window)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``r`` trigger an arbitrary ``release`` function defined in your source\n",
    "* ``b`` trigger an arbitrary ``build`` function defined in your source\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``v`` opens the automatic timeline viewer (only applicable for animations, mostly used for MIDI and AsciiTimeline-based animations)\n",
    "* ``p`` prints the current tree\n",
    "* ``u`` loads the next file in the directory (sorted alphabetically)\n",
    "* ``y`` loads the previous file in the directory (sorted alphabetically)\n",
    "* ``s`` shows the current file output directory in the finder\n",

    "To \"pin\" the window to corner of your screen, use the window-pin ``-wp`` argument and pass a compass direction (NE, SE, SW, NW), i.e. ``coldtype my-program.py -wp SE`` to have the window appear in the south-east corner of your screen\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove the window background and chrome and make the window itself completely transparent, pass ``-wt 1`` as an argument, i.e. ``coldtype my-program.py -wt 1``\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the initial scale of the window, pass the preview-scale argument ``-ps 2`` (for example), to get a double-sized window, i.e. ``coldtype my-program.py -ps 2``\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the opacity of your graphics displayed in the window, pass the window-opacity argument ``-wo 0.5`` (for example), to get a half-transparent window, i.e. ``coldtype my-program.py -wo 0.5``\n",
    "\n",
    "(All of these arguments can be combined, i.e. a window pinned to the south-west corner of your screen, with no background, 0.75 transparency, and a default size of 0.5x, would be: ``coldtype my-program.py -wt 1 -wp SW -wo 0.75 -ps 0.5``)"
